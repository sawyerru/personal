            <h1> Welcome! Let me introduce myself:</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>As a Wyoming native, I grew up surrounded my mountains, plains, wildlife, big skies, and adventure. 
              Over time, I knew college was my opportunity to expand my horizons and see new things, meet new people, and learn new things. 
              I ended up at Michigan State University (Go Sparty!) where I'm located now, happy with how things shook out. 
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>After some time figuring out my interests, I landed on a few core domains. 
              Eventually, MSU made me pick a major - so I landed on Computer Science. 
              I've always had an interest in technology, building things, money, financial markets, government, and making a difference.
              Due to this, I've developed a deep-seeded passion and interest in Financial Technology (FinTech) and the larger implications socailly. 
              Currently, my focus is on <i>Blockchain</i> technology. I love working to solve problems, add value, and learn new things.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>I often miss the open spaces Michigan can't offer, but it's led me to meet incredible people who've changed my life. 
              Throughout this website, I'd like to add some more personal touches about my hobbies, thoughts, and whatever other content comes to mind. 
              I'm building this website for a few reasons:
              <ul>
                <li>Professional Development</li>
                <li>Personal Challenge</li>
                <li>Personal Documentation</li>
              </ul>
            So with that in mind, thanks for coming by!</h3>
